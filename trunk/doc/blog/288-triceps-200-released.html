Triceps 2.0.0 released

It's a grand day for Triceps: the version 2.0 is finally released. There aren't many code changes since the last snapshot but the documentation has been collected and edited together. The documentation has been a huge work that took over a year.

As a reminder, the code features of 2.0 include such things as the multithreading support, the streaming functions, TQL, and great many small improvements.
