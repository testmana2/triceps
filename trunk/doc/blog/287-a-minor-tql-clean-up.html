a minor TQL clean-up

I've been working on the documentation chapter about TQL, and noticed that its single-threaded version has not been updated to use the query name as the label in the response. So I've fixed it. The previous output like

query,{read table tSymbol}
lb1read OP_INSERT symbol="AAA" name="Absolute Auto Analytics Inc" eps="0.5"
+EOD,OP_NOP,lb1read

now becomes

query,{read table tSymbol}
query OP_INSERT symbol="AAA" name="Absolute Auto Analytics Inc" eps="0.5"
+EOD,OP_NOP,query

I've also added the optional argument for name override in SimpleServer::makeServerOutLabel().
